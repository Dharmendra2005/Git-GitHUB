stages-

U - untracked
A - added or staged
C - commited

making your own projects
making git available in our projects
making a checkpoint or saved point
     adding files
     staging files
     commiting files


git cmd which should be know first---------->
git status -s -> to know current status of unstaged or staged files
git log --oneline -> to know current status of  the saved point

to ignore file in the folder we create a new .gitignore file in that folder

how to make repo from vs code
1. first is connect github with your vscode tool
2. do git init
3. do git commit -m "" 
4. last is push that all commit(git push origin main) but it will not work because of repo went on github
5. so go in Source Control and u will see that folder and then there is option to do publish your repo 


going back to  some privious saved points
        logiging everything
        reverting back to saved point

        git reset -hard HARD~1,2,3,4...
        

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.-> do first intialize github
2.-> we can check which file in which stages- git status -s
3.-> we can check How much saved check points - git log --oneline  --graph
So ->
     git status tell about the status of files before and after commited files u have to some afte commit
     git log telling about all history of the files

what is opppsite of git init -> Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git it will disconnect the git 

Git Branching

git init
git branch - it will show main branch
git branch newbranchname - we are creating new branch
git switch branchname - we are going to that branch
git merge branchname - to conflic a branch in main branch
merging techniques - ff(fast forward) merge , three way merge

git branch -d branchname -> to delete branch

git switch -C branchname -> here we first create branch and switch to that branch

git stash -> this cmd when we do some changes in our branch but we don't to update that changes and want to keep in middle way
then to come back with middle way use - > git stash apply and clear stash -> git stash clear


---------------------------------------------------------->

Collabrating ->>

     first one create the folder 
     uplaod that folder on github
     add the collabrators
     everybody clone that repo from github
     for others ->>>create your own branch
     write your code in only your branch
     when u completed commit
     inform to others about coomit
     and last is first one guy take all(fetch) up to date branchs and merge all with the main branch
              git fetch - git fetch all branchs
              git branch - main uesr(first) git show all branchs
              git switch branchname - main guys can switch to branch and can see new code
              git switch master - then main comes to main branch
              git merge branchname - main guy merged that branch
     another- git switch master
              git fetch 
              git pull - fetch and merge together - after this  another guy can see merged code did by main guys
              

suppsed I did a commit for all files but didnot till now push How can we do uncommit that so for u have to use a cmd - git reset --soft HEAD~1
